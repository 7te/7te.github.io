## Improving Containers in Firefox


Due to a (project)[link] I'm currently working on, I'm researching how best to split multiple online identities in Firefox. If you aren't interested in reading that blog post, the long and short of it is that I want to create a new online persona with a fresh google/facebook/twitter account and document the types of content that are recommended to me. Therefore, removing as much as I can of the long arm of big tech's identification prowess is paramount.

*I am surprised that I haven't seen a more clear writeup on this, it's rare I come across something I want to do that someone hasn't done before me.* That said, let's get started.

I want to be able to set cookies, window size, and other browser settings for each container, in addition to proxies.
