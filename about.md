# why

_I suppose I have a certain penchant for small, personal websites. It comes from the fact that as I first started using the internet, the majority of websites that existed were like this, simple, fast, and intensely personal. These days, the majority of websites that we use are owned and maintained by companies. I don't inherently have issues with that, but I **do** think that the death of personal websites is quite a sad one, as it signals the end of an age of the internet. I've never been particularly good at sticking things, but I am going to attempt to use this frequently, both for myself, and also potentially for others._
